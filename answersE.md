ANS1

Components of a DBMS
Hardware – Physical devices like servers, storage, and network infrastructure that support database operations.

Software – The DBMS software that manages the database, including query processing and transaction management.

Data – The actual information stored in the database, organized in tables, records, and fields.

Database Engine – The core service for storing, processing, and securing data, enabling interaction between the database and users.

Query Processor – Interprets and executes database queries written in SQL or other languages.

Metadata – Data about the database structure, such as table schemas, indexes, and constraints.

User Interface – Tools like command-line interfaces (CLI), graphical user interfaces (GUI), and dashboards for interacting with the database.

Transaction Management – Ensures data integrity and consistency by handling transactions (e.g., commit, rollback).

Security Management – Implements authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect data.

Backup and Recovery – Ensures data is protected against loss through regular backups and recovery mechanisms.








ANS2


A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns, where relationships between tables are established using primary keys and foreign keys. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

Examples of Relational Databases:
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle Database



ANS3


Three Classifications of SQL

Data Definition Language (DDL) – Defines and manages database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
Data Manipulation Language (DML) – Manages data within tables (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Data Control Language (DCL) – Controls access and security (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).



ANS4


. Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Foreign Key: Refers to a primary key in another table to establish a relationship.



ANS5


Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

A visual representation of database entities and their relationships.
Uses symbols like rectangles (entities), ovals (attributes), and diamonds (relationships).


ANS6


Advantages of Relational Databases

Data Integrity – Maintains accuracy and consistency.
Eliminates Redundancy – Normalization reduces duplicate data.
Scalability – Handles large amounts of data efficiently.
Security – Allows user authentication and access control.




ANS7


Four Types of Data Used in Tables

Integer (INT) – Stores whole numbers.
Varchar (VARCHAR) – Stores variable-length text.
Date/Time (DATE, TIMESTAMP) – Stores date and time values.
Boolean (BOOLEAN) – Stores TRUE or FALSE values.




ANS8


Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)

Stores, organizes, and manages data efficiently.
Provides data security and integrity.
Allows multi-user access and data retrieval.
Supports backup and recovery for data protection.
